# Project Euler Solutions

Welcome to my repository for Project Euler solutions. I started this project after discovering Project Euler through Jadi's Python course, where I solved a few problems and was inspired to tackle more. This repository contains my solutions to various Project Euler problems.

## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. It provides a platform to improve your problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking. The problems range from easy to very challenging, encouraging learning and application of mathematical and programming concepts.

## Purpose

I created this repository to:
- Document and share my solutions to Project Euler problems.
- Improve my Python coding skills and algorithmic thinking.
- Provide a resource for others who may be working on these problems.

Some of the solutions here are not fully optimized and could be improved. As I continue to solve more problems, I will keep updating and committing new solutions.

## Usage

Feel free to explore, use, or modify the code in this repository. If you have any questions or suggestions for improvements, please reach out or contribute!

## Contributions

If you would like to contribute to this repository or suggest optimizations for existing solutions, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
